Homer's Iliad is an epic poem, compiled around 800 BCE, that describes several weeks of the last year of the 10-year siege of Troy (Ilion) by the Achaeans. The story centers on the rage of the great warrior Achilles. But it includes many details of injuries and outcomes, and is thus the oldest record of Greek medicine. The data report 146 recorded injuries for which both injury site and outcome are provided in the Iliad (Hutchinson, 2013).

**Research Question:** Is the body location of an injury associated with whether the injury was fatal?
