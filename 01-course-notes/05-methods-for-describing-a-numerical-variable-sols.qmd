Now, we will consider descriptive methods appropriate for summarizing numerical variables.  

## Example 5.1: IMDb Movie Reviews

A data set was collected on movies released in 2020. Here is a list of some of the variables collected on the observational units (each movie):

| **Variable**     | **Description**                                             |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `Movie`          | Title of the movie                                          |
| `averageRating`  | Average IMDb user rating score from 1 to 10                 |
| `numVotes`       | Number of votes from IMDb users                             |
| `Genre`          | Categories the movie falls into (e.g., Action, Drama, etc.) |
| `2020 Gross`     | Gross profit from movie viewing                             |
| `runtimeMinutes` | Length of movie (in minutes)                                |
|                  |                                                             |

```{r data}
#| include: false

library(tidyverse)
library(infer)
movies <- readxl::read_xlsx("data/movies_2020.xlsx") |> 
  distinct(Movie, .keep_all = TRUE)

title_ids <- read_csv("data/movie_ids.csv")
  
movie_ids <- left_join(movies, 
                       title_ids, 
                       by = 
                         intersect(
                           colnames(movies), 
                           colnames(title_ids)
                           )
                       )

ratings <- read_csv("data/ratings.csv")

movie_ratings <- left_join(movie_ids, 
                           ratings, 
                           by = "id"
                           ) |>  
  select(Movie, 
         Genre, 
         `2020 Gross`, 
         runtimeMinutes, 
         averageRating, 
         numVotes) |>  
  drop_na(averageRating)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
head(movie_ratings)
```

1. What is the variable of interest? What is the data type?


<span style="color:blue;">averageRating (this is the IMBD score), numeric variable</span>

2. What is the observation?

<span style="color:blue;">A move released in 2020</span>

The `favstats` function from the `mosaic` package will provide us with key summary statistics for a numerical variable:

```{r}
#| echo: true
library(mosaic) # <1>
favstats(~ averageRating, data = movie_ratings) # <2>
```

1. Load the `mosaic` package to access the desired functions.
2. Using the `favstats()` function, designate your `~ variable` and your `data = ` set.

+ <span style="color:blue;">The smallest IMDb score is 1.9 (min) and the largest IMDb score is 9.2 (max).</span>
+ <span style="color:blue;">There are 215 movies in the data set (n) and 0 movies have missing IMDb scores.</span>
+ <span style="color:blue;">Q1 (quartile 1) gives the IMDB score where 25% of the movies have scores lower than 6.1.</span>
+ <span style="color:blue;">Q3 (quartile 3) gives the IMDB score where 75% of the movies have scores lower than 7.6.</span>
+ <span style="color:blue;">The IQR (inner-quartile range) is Q3-Q1 = 7.6-6.1 = 1.5. Thus, 50% of movies have scores between 6.1 and 7.6 (within a range of 1.5).</span>

Next, let’s discuss the summary statistics provided in each piece of the output:

::: callout-note
### Measures of location and variability

**Measures of location** These summaries give us an idea of where a data distribution lies.

+ **Mean** and **median** give us an idea of the center (or middle) of the distribution.
+ The percentiles (**Q1** and **Q3**) give us an idea of what percent of the data distribution lies at or below a particular value. 

What summary (or summaries) we choose to describe the entire data set depends on our objective. If the goal is to describe where a data distribution is centered, then the mean or median may be an appropriate summary statistic. However, if interest lies in what value is exceeded by only 5% of the data distribution, for example, then we would use the 95th percentile.  

\vspace{0.1in}

**Measures of variability** These summaries help us quantify how much the observations in a data set tend to vary from each other. 

+ The **sd** (standard deviation) is a measure of variability and quantifies how individual data points vary from the mean. 
+ The **IQR** (inner-quartile range) is the distance between Q1 and Q3 (the first and third quartiles).
:::

For example, compare and contrast the variability in the following distributions. The first is the actual data distribution of IMDB movie ratings; the second is a hypothetical data set created for purposes of comparison.  Which data set has more variability?  Why?

```{r dotplot-orig}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-width: 12
#| fig-height: 3
ggplot(data = movie_ratings, 
       mapping = aes(x = averageRating)) +
  geom_dotplot(dotsize = 0.1, method="histodot") +
  labs(title = "Original Data Set", # Title for plot
       x = "IMDb Score (Average Rating)", # Label for x axis
       y = "Number of Movies" # Label for y axis
       ) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank()) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1,10), breaks = seq(1,10,1))
```

```{r dotplot-simulated}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-width: 12
#| fig-height: 3


# Set the seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)
fake_data <- tibble(averageRating = c(rnorm(n = nrow(movie_ratings)-10, 
                                          mean = mean(movie_ratings$averageRating),
                                          sd = sd(movie_ratings$averageRating)/2
                                          ),
                                      runif(n = 10, 4, 5)
)
                    )
ggplot(data = fake_data, 
       mapping = aes(x = averageRating)) +
  geom_dotplot(dotsize = 0.1, method="histodot") +
  labs(title = "Hypothetical Data Set", # Title for plot
       x = "IMDb Score (Average Rating)", # Label for x axis
       y = "Number of Movies" # Label for y axis
       ) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank()) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1,10), breaks = seq(1,10,1))
```

<span style="color:blue;">The top original data set has more variability in the IMDb scores because they range from 1.5 to 9.3 and have more spread in general, a less prominent squished distribution and peak.</span>

<span style="color:blue;">looking at the favstats output on the previous page...</span>

3. How many observations are there in the data set?

<span style="color:blue;">n = 215</span>

4. What is the mean IMDb Score for the data set?

<span style="color:blue;">$\bar x$ = 6.7</span>

5. What is the lowest IMDb Score? The highest?

<span style="color:blue;">lowest = 1.9 (min) and highest = 9.2 (max)</span>

6. Interpret the value of the standard deviation in the context of these data.

<span style="color:blue;">sd = 1.25 (see last page for a better description)</span>

<span style="color:blue;">On average, a movie has an IMDb score 1.25 away from the overall mean IMDb score of 6.7.</span>

## Graphical Summaries of Numerical Data

In this section, we will discuss common methods for graphing numerical data.  Graphs conveniently allow us to examine both the location and the variability in a data set.  Moreover, we gain insight into the shape of a data distribution.

### Dotplots

A dotplot will plot a dot for each value in the data set. The code below was used to create a dotplot of the `averageRatings` variable from the movies data set.

```{r dotplot-echo}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
ggplot(data = movie_ratings, # <1>
       mapping = aes(x = averageRating) # <2>
       ) +
  geom_dotplot(dotsize = 0.5,  # <3>
               method = "histodot"
               ) +
  labs(title = "Score of Movies from 2020",  # <4>
       x = "IMDb Score (Average Rating)",
       y = "Number of Movies"
       )
```

1. Using the `ggplot()` function, tell R the data set name,
2. and the `aes(x = ____)` quantitative variable.
3. The geometric object we want to display is a `geom_dotplot`. We can adjust the `dotsize`.
4. Don't forget to label your title, x-, and y-axes.

```{r dotplot-eval}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 70%
#| fig-pos: H
ggplot(data = movie_ratings, 
       mapping = aes(x = averageRating)) +
  geom_dotplot(dotsize = 0.5, method = "histodot") +
  labs(title = "Score of Movies from 2020", # Title for plot
       x = "IMDb Score (Average Rating)", # Label for x axis
       y = "Number of ___________" # Label for y axis
       ) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank()) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1,10), breaks = seq(1,10,1))
```

7. What does each dot on the dotplot represent?

<span style="color:blue;">A single movie (observation). Note, this is NOT a sampling distribution (we will talk about this in Ch. 6). There are 215 dots on this plot (one for each movie's score).</span>

8. How would you describe the shape of the distribution of IMDb scores? Think about measures of location and variability.

<span style="color:blue;">When describing the distribution, address the center, spread, shape, and any outliers.</span>

+ <span style="color:blue;">Center: movie scores are cenetered around ~6.7-7.0</span>
+ <span style="color:blue;">Spread: 50% of the movies have scores between 6.1 and 7.6 (IQR = 1.5).</span>
+ <span style="color:blue;">Shape: Slightly skewed left</span>
+ <span style="color:blue;">xxx</span>


### Histogram

A histogram is created by dividing the range of the data distribution into bins and then counting the number of observations that fall in each bin  A rectangular column is plotted in each interval, and the height of the column is proportional to the frequency of observations within the interval.  The y-axis can be labeled with either the count or the percentage of the observations that fall in each interval.

```{r dotplot-histo}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 75%
ggplot(data = movie_ratings, 
       mapping = aes(x = averageRating)) +
  geom_dotplot(dotsize = 0.5, method="histodot") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1.25, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1.75, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2.25, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2.75, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 3.25, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 3.75, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 4.25, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 4.75, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.25, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.75, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 6.25, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 6.75, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 7.25, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 7.75, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 8.25, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 8.75, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 9.25, linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(title = "Score of Movies from 2020", # Title for plot
       x = "IMDb Score (Average Rating)", # Label for x axis
       y = "Number of Movies" # Label for y axis
       ) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank()) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1,10), breaks = seq(1,10,1))
```
\newpage

To create a histogram of the IMDb scores, all we need to do is change the geometric object we are displaying on our plot! In a dotplot we use dots, but in a histogram we use bars.

```{r histogram-echo}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
ggplot(data = movie_ratings, # <1>
       mapping = aes(x = averageRating) # <2>
       ) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5) + # <3>
  labs(title = "Score of Movies from 2020", # <4>
       x = "IMDb Score (Average Rating)",
       y = "Number of Movies"
       )
```

1. Using the `ggplot()` function, denote your `data = ` set,
2. and the `x = ` variable you want to explore.
3. The geometric object we want to plot is `geom_histogram()` and we can specify the `binwidth = `.
4. Don't forget to add titles, x-, and y-axes labels.

```{r histogram}
#| warning: false
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 75%
ggplot(data = movie_ratings, 
       mapping = aes(x = averageRating)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, fill = "gray", color = "white") +
  labs(title = "Score of Movies from 2020", # Title for plot
       x = "IMDb Score (Average Rating)", # Label for x axis
       y = "Number of Movies" # Label for y axis
       ) +
  # scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,10), breaks = seq(0,10,1), expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1,10), breaks = seq(1,10,1))
```

<span style="color:blue;">Think of this as a "bar plot" of numerical data. We create "bins" or "categories" of the numeric values (IMDb scores).</span>

4. Which range of IMDb scores have the *highest* frequency (number of movies)?

<span style="color:blue;">6.75 - 5.25 has the most movies in this range of IMDb scores.</span>

5. What IMDB scores are movies *rarely* rated?

<span style="color:blue;">1.75 - 4.25 all have 4 or less movies rated in each bin. Also 8.75-9.25 only has one movie rated in that "bin".</span>

6. Are there IMDB scores that were possible but no movies in this sample were given those ratings?

<span style="color:blue;">Yes, the data description on the first page says movie ratings are 1-10. We have no movies rated lower than 1.75 and none rated above 9.25.</span>

### Boxplot

The procedure for constructing a boxplot is as follows:

1.	Draw horizontal lines at Q1 (25th percentile), Q2 (median / 50th percentile), and Q3 (75th percentile).  Enclose these horizontal lines in a box.
2.	Find the lower and upper whiskers:

+ The endpoint of the lower whisker is the larger of the minimum and (Q1 – 1.5*IQR).
+ The endpoint of the upper whisker is the smaller of the maximum and (Q3 + 1.5*IQR).

::: callout-note
### Outliers

Any measurement beyond the endpoint of either whisker is classified as a potential outlier (an extreme observation).
:::

**Recall our Summary Statistics**

```{r}
#| echo: true
library(infer)
favstats(~ averageRating, data = movie_ratings)
```

**Bottom 6 and Top 6 Ratings**

```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 2

#| tbl-cap: "Top 6 Ratings"
movie_ratings %>% 
  select(Movie, averageRating) |> 
  slice_max(order_by = averageRating, n = 6)

#| tbl-cap: "Bottom 6 Ratings"
movie_ratings |> 
  select(Movie, averageRating) |>  
  slice_min(order_by = averageRating, n = 6) |> 
  arrange(-averageRating)
```

\newpage

7. Using the summary statistics (same as we saw earlier) and top/bottom values of the data set provided, sketch a box plot of IMDb scores. *Hint: You will need to determine if there are any outliers.*

```{r}
#| out-width: 80%
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("05-images/boxplot-sols.PNG")
```

8.	Are there any movies that are rated unusually low?  If so, which ones?

<span style="color:blue;">Any movies with IMDb scores less than Q1 - 1.5*IQR = 6.1 - 1.5(1.5) = 6.1-2.25 = 3.85 are considered outliers. Thus, yes, there are 5 movies with IMDb scores less than 3.85.</span>

9.	Are there any movies that are rated unusually high?  If so, which ones?

<span style="color:blue;">Any movies with IMDb scores higher than Q3 + 1.5*IQR = 9.2 + 1.5(1.5) = 9.2-2.25 = 11.45 are considered outliers. Thus, no, there are no movies with IMDb scores higher than 11.45.</span>

### A Discussion of Skewness

A data distribution is said to be symmetric if it has the same shape on both sides of the center. Skewness measures the amount of asymmetry in a data distribution.

The distribution is said to be *skewed to the right* if the measurements tend to trail off to the right.  Similarly, a distribution is *skewed to the left* if the measurements trail off to the left.


```{r}

```


\newpage

::: callout-note
## Describing distributions of quantitative variables

When describing distributions of quantitative variables we look at the **shape**, **center**, **spread**, and for **outliers**.

  + There are two measures of *center*: mean and the median
  + There are two measures of *spread*: standard deviation and the interquartile range, IQR = Q3 − Q1.
:::

10. Compare the three graphs of IMDb scores created above.

+ Which graph(s) show the shape of the distribution?

<span style="color:blue;">histograms do the best job of showing the shape, although dot plots do okay too.</span>

+ Which graph(s) show the outliers of the distribution?

<span style="color:blue;">boxplots do the best job at showing outliers, although you can kind of guess from dot plots.</span>

+ Which graph plots the raw data (individual observations)?

<span style="color:blue;">dot plots show the raw individual observations.</span>

## Z-SCORES

A *Z-score*, often called a standardized value, measures the number of standard deviations a single observation is away from the mean of the data distribution. The z-score can be used to transform observations to a dimensionless scale; in addition, it can be used to measure the position of an observation. Z-scores are calculated as shown below:

$$\text{Z-score} = \frac{\text{Observation - Mean}}{\text{Standard Deviation}}$$

Interpretation of Z-Scores:

+ As mentioned, the standardized values transform the data so that the data is placed on a standard, dimensionless scale that has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
+ If a Z-Score is negative, then the observation is that many standard deviations below the mean.
+ If the Z-Score is positive, then the observation is that many standard deviations above the mean.
+ If the Z-Score is 0, then the data value is the same as the mean.
+ If the Standard Deviation is 0, then the Z-Score is not defined and thus cannot be computed.

```{r}
movie_ratings |> 
  mutate(Zscore = (averageRating - mean(averageRating))/sd(averageRating)) |> 
  select(Movie, averageRating, Zscore) |> 
  head()
```

11.	Show how the Z-score for "Halloween" was calculated:

<span style="color:blue;">(7.8 - 6.7)/1.25 = 0.88</span>

12.	What does this tell you about the relative position of "Halloween" in the data set?

<span style="color:blue;">Halloween falls just under 1 standard deviation above the mean of 6.7.</span>

<span style="color:blue;">Think of having a popsicle stick the length of your sd (1.25). If you place this at the mean score, Halloween (7.8) would fall almost at the top of that popsicle stick.</span>
 
13.	Show how the Z-score for "The Call of the Wild" was calculated:

<span style="color:blue;">(5.3 - 6.7)/1.25 = -1.12</span>

14.	What does this tell you about the relative position of "The Call of the Wild" in the data set?

<span style="color:blue;">Halloween falls just over 1 standard deviation below the mean of 6.7.</span>

<span style="color:blue;">Think of having a popsicle stick the length of your sd (1.25). If you place this at the mean score, The Call of the Wild (5.3) would fall just past the end of that popsicle stick.</span>

```
 
## The Identification of Outliers

We have already discussed using boxplots to identify outliers.  In addition, we can use Z-scores.

+ Any data value whose Z-Score is below −2 or above 2 is considered a potential outlier.  
+ Any data value whose Z-Score is below -3 or above 3 is considered an outlier and warrants further investigation.

These guidelines come from the Empirical Rule: If the probability distribution is bell-shaped and symmetric, then the Empirical Rule applies.  This rule says that APPROXIMATELY…

+ 68% of the data values fall within one standard deviation of the mean.
+ 95% of the data values fall within two standard deviations of the mean.
+ 99.7% of the data values fall within three standard deviations of the mean.
