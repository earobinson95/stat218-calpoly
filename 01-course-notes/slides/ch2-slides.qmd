#| fig-cap: "R Knowledge Rollercoaster by Allison Horst"
#| fig-alt: "An illustrated cartoon graph with “How much I think I know about R” on the y-axis, with axis labels at “I know nothing” and “I know lots”, versus “time” on the x-axis. The line varies widely between the two. Above the line are emoji-like faces, showing uncertainty and hope early on. At a second peak is the label “join R community on twitter”, with a “mind-blown” emoji face. The line quickly descends, but with a happy looking emoji character sliding down it."
