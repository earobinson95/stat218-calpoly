## Yesterday...

What is the difference between a chi-square test of independence and a chi-square goodness-of-fit test? How do you know when to use each one?

## Overview of Chi-Square Tests

- **Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test**: Tests whether the distribution of one categorical variable with more than two groups matches a pre-specified distribution.
- **Chi-Square Test of Independence**: Tests whether two categorical variables are independent of each other.

## Overview of Chi-Square Tests

$$X^2 = \sum{\frac{(Observed - Expected)^2}{Expected}}$$

- **Expected Counts**:
  - For **Goodness-of-Fit**: Based on a known or "status quo" distribution.
  - For **Independence Test**: Based on row and column totals from the contingency table.
  
## Simulation vs Theory Based

**Simulation:** Always works!

+ `simulate.p.value = TRUE`

**Theory:** Uses the chi-square distribution to approximate the simulated null distribution.

+ Degrees of Freedom:
  + Goodness-of-Fit: $\text{# categories} - 1$
  + Independence: $(\text{# categories explanatory} - 1)(\text{# categories response} - 1)$
+ Requires conditions: Large sample sizes (expected counts > 5)

## Key Differences

| Test                        | Number of Variables | Purpose                                      |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Chi-Square Test of Independence | 2 categorical   | Test for relationship between variables       |
| Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit   | 1 categorical      | Compare data to expected distribution |

## Common Misconceptions

- **Misconception 1**: "Both tests measure relationships between variables."
  - **Clarification**: Only the test of independence measures relationships between two variables. The goodness-of-fit test compares the data to expected for a single categorical variable with more than two categories.

## Common Misconceptions

- **Misconception**: "Test of independence is for small sample sizes."
  - **Clarification**: If using the chi-square distribution, both tests require sufficiently large expected counts in each category (commonly at least 5).
