## Thursday, Sept. 26 -- Today we will...

+ If you haven't:
  + join the posit Cloud *Master* workspace
  + purchase student subscription ($5/mo)
+ Meeting your group
+ Intro to R/RStudio/Quarto/Posit
+ Lab 0: Setting up posit Cloud

## Meet your group!

Please find your team members and introduce yourself by sharing something about your name.

Logistics:

+ Exchange contact information (email, discord, text, etc.).
+ Labs will *typically* be started in class on Thursdays and due Monday nights. Discuss in what modality you might meet outside of class to finish labs (if necessary) -- Zoom, meet in Union, meet in Dorm general space, etc.

## Introduction to Tools

+ `R` is a programming language designed originally for *statistical analyses*.
+ `RStudio` is the integrated development environment (software that helps us write the code)
+ `Posit` is a company that oversees RStudio and offers a browser-based version (posit Cloud)
+ `Quarto` is the collaborative document you will actually work in. Think Google doc with a fancy calculator built in.

## R -- Packages and Functions

Just like operations such as `+` and `-` on a calculator, `R` contains **functions** that accomplish certain tasks such as:

+ read in data,
+ calculate a mean,
+ create a graph, and
+ conduct a statistical analysis.

::: fragment

The heart and soul of **R** are **packages**.

+ These are "extra" sets of code that add **new functions** to R when installed.

:::

## What is RStudio?

**RStudio** is an IDE (*Integrated Developer Environment*).

+ This means it is an application that makes it easier for you to interact with **R**.

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 75%
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0b4d0569b2ddf6147da90b110fbb2a17653c8b08/f06f3/images/shutterstock/r_vs_rstudio_1.png")
```

##

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://srvanderplas.github.io/stat-computing-r-python/images/tools/Rstudio-important-buttons.png")
```

## Notebooks

Notebooks are an implementation of **literate programming**.

+ They allow you to integrate code, output, text, images, etc. into a single document.
+ E.g.,

  + R Markdown notebook
  + **Quarto notebook**
  + Jupyter notebook

**Reproducibility!**


## What is Markdown?

**Markdown** (without the "R") is a *markup language*.  

+ It uses special symbols and formatting to make pretty documents.

+ Markdown files have the **.md** extension.

</center>


## Quarto Formats

Quarto makes moving between outputs straightforward.

+ All that needs to change between these formats is a few lines in the front matter (YAML)!

**Document**

``` yaml
title: "Lab 0"
author: "Dr. Robinson"
date: "9/26/2024"
format: pdf
```


## Quarto Components

## Markdown in Quarto

A few useful tips for formatting the **Markdown** text in your document:

+ \*text\* -- makes italics
+ \*\*text\*\* -- makes bold text
+ \# -- makes headers
+ !\[ \]( ) -- includes images or HTML links
+ \< \> -- embeds URLs


## R Code Options in Quarto

**R code chunk** options are included at the top of each code chunk, prefaced with a #| (hashpipe).

+ These options control how the following code is run and reported in the final Quarto document.

## Rendering your Quarto Document

To take your *.qmd* file and make it look pretty, you have to **render** it.

<center>

![](images/render_on_save.png)

</center>

## When you click **Render**...

-   Your file is saved.
-   The R code written in your *.qmd* file gets run **in order**.
    -   It starts from scratch, even if you previously ran some of the code.
-   A new file is created.
    -   If your Quarto file is called "Lab0.qmd", then a file called "Lab0.pdf" will be created.
    -   This will be saved in the bottom right quadrant (Files tab); you will export this from Posit Cloud to your computer.
