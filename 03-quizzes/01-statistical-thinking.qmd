8.	Suppose you want to investigate the question, “What percent of Americans support stronger gun laws?” 
Identify the observational unit and variable of interest. (3 pts)

a.	Observational unit = opinion on gun laws, variable = number of people who support stronger gun laws
b.	Observational unit = opinion on gun laws, variable = political affiliation
c.	Observational unit = an American, variable = opinion on gun laws
d.	Observational unit = an American, variable = number of people who support stronger gun laws


9.	A student participates in a Coke versus Pepsi taste test. She correctly identifies which soda is which five times out of six tries. She claims that this proves that she can reliably tell the difference between the two soft drinks. You have studied statistics and you want to determine the probability of anyone getting at least five right out of six tries just by chance alone. Which of the following would provide an accurate estimate of that probability? (3 pts)
a.	Have the student repeat this experiment many times and calculate the percentage of times she correctly distinguishes between the brands. 
b.	Simulate this on the computer with a 50% chance of guessing the correct soft drink on each try, and calculate the percent of times there are five or more correct guesses out of six trials.
c.	Repeat this experiment with a very large sample of people and calculate the percentage of people who make five correct guesses out of six tries. 
d.	All of the methods listed above would provide an accurate estimate of the probability.

Questions 24 - 27 refer to the following scenario. Researchers carried out a study to investigate whether two-year-old children learn words through overhearing the conversations of others. In this study, the child sat and watched while the experimenter introduced four new objects to another adult. All four objects were originally placed in a bucket so that they were hidden from sight. One of the four objects was considered the “target” object, and the other three were considered “neutral” objects. For each of the three neutral objects, the researcher would say, “I’ll show you this one” and then pull it out the bucket. However, before introducing the target object to the other adult, the researcher would say, “I’ll show you the toma.” After the child had overheard this conversation between the researcher and the other adult, the researcher presented all four objects to the child and asked him or her to find the “toma.” This was repeated for each of 12 two-year-old subjects, and the researchers kept track of how many could correctly identify the target object.
Research Question:  Is there evidence that children learn new words through overhearing? In other words, is there evidence that more two-year-olds are correctly identifying the target object than we would expect by chance? 

24.	Which of the following gives the best description of the population of interest? (3 pts)
a.	The 12 two-year-olds observed in this study
b.	The 10 two-year-olds that correctly identified the target object
c.	The true proportion of all two-year-olds that would correctly identify the target object
d.	All two-year-olds


25.	Suppose the researchers will conduct a simulation study in Tinkerplots to get an idea of what outcomes to anticipate if the children are really not able to learn new words through overhearing and are simply guessing when asked to find the target object. Which of the following spinners should the researchers use? (3 pts)

a.	 	b.  

c.     	d.  

26.	Suppose the researchers carried out 100 simulated trials of the experiment, and the number of children that correctly identified the target object when guessing was recorded for each simulated trial. The results are summarized below.

 


Answer the following true/false questions by circling the correct response. (2 pts each)


An observed outcome of 2 students identifying the correct item would provide evidence that children are learning new words from overhearing because this outcome occurred quite often in the simulation study.
	TRUE     FALSE

An observed outcome of 10 students identifying the correct item would not provide evidence that children are learning new words from overhearing because this outcome never occurred in the simulation study.
	TRUE     FALSE










1. In a study conducted by researchers at the Marine Biology Institute in Monterey, California, a dolphin named Luna was the focus of an investigation into whether bottlenose dolphins demonstrated the ability to identify edible fish species, herring, based on their distinct vocalizations. The researchers conducted a series of trials using underwater recordings of fish vocalizations.

> During the trials, Luna the bottlenose dolphin was presented with two different underwater sound recordings, each corresponding to a different fish species: herring and pufferfish. Luna was observed in her natural habitat, and she was allowed to swim freely near the sound sources. Out of 60 trials, Luna accurately identified the herring sound recording 39 times.

> `r fontawesome::fa("question")` **Research Question:** Can it be concluded, based on Luna's observations, that the bottlenose dolphin Luna is better at identifying the herring fish species based on vocalizations compared to random chance?

a. Identify the following in the context of this example (4 pts):

-   Population of interest:

\vspace{0.2in}

-   Sample (and Sample Size):

-   Variable of interest:

-   Data type:

b. If Luna the bottlenose dolphin were randomly selecting between two types of fish for her meal, how many times would you expect her to accurately identified the herring sound recording? Explain. (2 pts)

Below is a dot plot displaying 100 simulations of the number of times Luna accurately identified the herring sound recording under the assumption that her selections were made at random.

c. Based on the dot plot of 100 simulations of the number of times Luna correctly identified the herring sound recording, does this outcome convince you that Luna's ability to identify edible fish species is more than random chance? Why or why not? (3 pts)

2. Recall **Example 1.4: Font Preferences**.

> Researchers carried out a marketing field study in order to study preferences of potential consumers in the U.S.  They used silver cardboard boxes to contain chocolate truffles in a forced choice task. All of the box tops were decorated in the same way, and a white label was attached to each bearing the name *“Indulgence”* in either Signet font or Salem font.  The text on each label was approximately equal-sized.  For each of the 40 subjects in the study, one box labeled with the Signet font and another box labeled with the Salem font were placed on a tray, and the subject was simply asked to choose a truffle from one of the two boxes that were on the tray in front of them. 

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 60%
#| fig-pos: "H"
knitr::include_graphics("../01-course-notes/01-images/font-style-image.png")
```

> The researchers aren’t sure which font is more appropriate for the label and simply want to know whether the majority of all consumers will choose the truffles with one font more than the other.

Why was it important for the researchers to present balance out the order in which the fonts were presented across the study? For example, how would the study results have been affected if the researchers always presented the Signet font on the left? (3 pts)
